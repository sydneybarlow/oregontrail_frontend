Oregon Trail is a game that I built using React.js.

Oregon Trail is a game where the user makes a family and then tries to keep him/herself and their family alive as they adventure across the western plains of America. The point of the game is to have as many people in your family alive and well by the time you get to Oregon City, Oregon.

This game mimics the original 80's version - but with quite a few changes.

In this NEW AND IMPROVED version family members can get eaten by dinosaurs, and get anthrax in the mail along with the good-old-fashioned broken arm and dysentery that most people remember with the original. 

A user can login in and logout, sign in and sign up. When the user signs up - they will then be sent to a form where they get to make their family members. They must make 4 members.

They will then be able to purchase supplies like bullets and pounds of food. Currently purchasing supplies does not take away from the money that a user has. That is a future improvement I am currently working on. Once the family is made and the supplies are purchased - you are then sent to the homepage of the game.

As the user travels, the user can hunt to earn more supplies for his/her family and can rest if the family member's health is low. The user is also informed of when they reach towns along the way.

When the user makes it to Oregon City, Oregon it initiates a 'Game Over' and the game starts over from the beginning. A future improvement is that the user can then go back and make their family again and purchase supplies again so that they may play the game with a fresh start.
